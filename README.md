# distance-calculation-using-a-radar-
This repository consists of a radarpub(publisher) and radarsub(subscriber) files which are used to find the minimum distance in 1 clean sweep from a radar.
These are ros files so you have to run the "roscore" first and then run the radarpub and radar sub files.
Kvaser leaf cable was used to get the message id from radar.
